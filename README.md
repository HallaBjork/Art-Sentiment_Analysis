# MINI-PROJECT: INSIGHT INTO ART-RELATED HASHTAG


### The Assignment Description
This project should take one or more of the techniques for NLP you have learnt about in the course and apply it to a text corpus. The project should show a clear understanding of the technical approaches taught in the course and an ability to apply them to new problems and corpora. The student will use appropriate methods for analysing the outcomes of the project. Code used to realise the project is reasonably well organised, using comments to facilitate readability and understanding of what has been done.


### The Aim of the Project:
This project is a journal of social text analysis. Its aim is to use NLP methods to gain insight into peopleâ€™s use of art-related hashtag (#art) by using unstructured data (tweets). What are the posts about that are being tagged with #art on Twitter and is it possible to see what emotions the users have toward the topics without context?
